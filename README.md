# 42 project - Piscine C++

## 9 modules to discover C++.

This 42 project regroups 9 differents modules. The goal of these modules is to introduce us to Object-Oriented Programming and to discover new programming concepts step-by-step. All the code must follow the C++98 standard.

### Modules details
- CPP00: Classes, member functions, and some other basic stuff;
- CPP01: Memory allocation, pointers and reference;
- CPP02: Polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form;
- CPP03: Inheritance;
- CPP04: Abstract classes and interfaces;
